# Fragment-Fun
11/6: Added additonal fragment. Next additon will probably be buttons in a fragment
11/11: Attempting to create multiple "pages" within a fragment
11/12: Figured out how to change things in a fragment (it has to be within that fragmen's java class and even then it isn't very clear)
11/13: Now that the structure is figured out, all we ahve to do is put in the information. The fragment hosts a multitude of buttons that each exist on certain "pages". All of these buttons technichally exist at the same time but changing the pages changes which are active and visible. This allows us to easily share buttons between pages and changes pages with a very simple, single input method.

11/25: Development of Warfarin Guide Written to put useful protocols on Warfarin adjustment,

Using fragments, the app allows for clean navigation between multiple pages and an easily changeable format and text for informational updates.
